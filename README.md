# IMAGE-CAPTION-GENERATOR

This project leverages deep learning to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. Using the Flickr8k dataset, which contains thousands of images with corresponding captions, the model learns to understand and describe visual content in natural language. The project involves key steps like data preprocessing, feature extraction with CNNs (e.g., VGG16), and sequence modeling with LSTMs to generate accurate captions.
